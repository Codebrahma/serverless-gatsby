We've just released v1.10 of the Serverless Framework! Let's take a look at all the new features.

## Highlights of 1.10.0

**Note:** You can find a complete list of all the updates in the [changelog](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Support for Node.js 6.10 Runtime

AWS recently announced that Lambda [now supports Node.js 6.10](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/03/aws-lambda-supports-node-js-6-10/).

Serverless has got you covered. All the new Node.js services you create with the help of the `serverless create --template aws-nodejs` command ship with the new Node.js 6.10 runtime out of the box.

However, if you've got an old service and want to use the new runtime you simply need to update the `runtime` property in your `serverless.yml` file:

```diff
provider:
  name: aws
- runtime: nodejs4.3
+ runtime: nodejs6.10
```

**Note:** Please make sure to check the breaking changes an update to `nodejs6.10` introduces so that your service still works flawlessly.

[Breaking changes between v5 and v6](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Breaking-changes-between-v5-and-v6)

### AWS Groovy Gradle Template

You can now use the `aws-groovy-gradle` template option when creating a new service:

```bash
serverless create --template aws-groovy-gradle
```

This creates a basic Serverless service for Groovy on the JVM which uses the `gradle` build tool.

### Faster Deploy Times for Large Services

The Serverless Framework relies on CloudFormation to deploy the service with its infrastructure in a consistent and reliable way.

CloudFormation itself uses a graph representation to identify how and in which order the infrastructure components should be deployed.

v1.10 of the Serverless Framework includes an improvement where resources are defined in a way which helps CloudFormation to deploy them in parallel rather than sequentially. Making the deployment process faster.

Especially large Serverless services will be deployed in significantly less time.

### Entrypoints for Plugins

Plugin authors can now specify `entrypoints` for their plugins which makes it possible for other plugins to hook into those specific lifecycle events.

Here's a simple plugin definition which utilizes the new `entrypoint` property:

```javascript
this.commands = {
  package: {
    // uppermost command is an entrypoint other plugins can use
    type: 'entrypoint',
    commands: {
      build: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'prepare',
        ],
      },
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'upload',
        ],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

This makes something like the following hook usage possible:

```javascript
'package:build:prepare': () => BbPromise.bind(this)
  .then(this.validate)
  .then(this.mergeCustomProviderResources),
```

If you're interested in the motivation of this plugin enhancement then you should definitely read the blog post about [extending the core lifecycle events](https://serverless.com/blog/advanced-plugin-development-extending-the-core-lifecycle/) by [Frank Schmid](https://github.com/HyperBrain) who PRed this change.

**Note:** This change will make it possible to introduce the [`package` and `deploy` commands](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3344) in a non-breaking way!
