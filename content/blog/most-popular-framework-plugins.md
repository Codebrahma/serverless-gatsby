"Don't build it again if someone else already open-sourced it for you." Signed, every developer ever.

In other words, if you haven't yet checked out this [huge list of Serverless Framework plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins), you're missing out. Because they are *slick*. And *useful*. And *ready to use right now*.

Fortunately and unfortunately, there are also close to 150 of them. Yew! Where do you even begin?

HERE. That's where.

We hereby present the most popular plugins for the Serverless Framework (plus a goodie bag of our own team's favorites).

# The community's most-loved Framework plugins (by GitHub stars)
