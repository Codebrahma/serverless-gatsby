We've seen it time and time again: companies get tremendous cost savings when they port over into the serverless realm.

**Some real world examples:**

- <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-cut-my-aws-bill-by-90-35c937596f0c" target="_blank">How I cut my AWS bill by 90% by going serverless</a>
- <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/08/serverless-autodesk" target="_blank">Costs a small fraction (~1%) of the traditional cloud approach</a>
- <a href="https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/aws-lambda-9-million-api-calls-for-1-1134243c55d7" target="_blank">AWS Lambda: 9 million API calls for $1</a>

What if I told you...it just got even cheaper?  

## Serverless & Spotinst team up

Introducing the latest serverless provider integration, [Spotinst](https://spotinst.com/products/spotinst-functions/).

<img align='right' width="300" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/spotinst-post/sls-and-spotinst.png"/>

[Spotinst Functions](https://spotinst.com/products/spotinst-functions/) enables users to deploy multi-cloud functions at Spot Prices. By leveraging spot instances, you could **save 50 to 80%** over standard serverless FaaS pricing.

### Spotinst supported runtimes

Spotinst currently supports Node (4, 6, & 8.3), Java, Python, Ruby, Go as function runtimes.

### Cross-cloud deployments

Spotinst functions can be deployed simultaneously in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

This ability to deploy across clouds improves SLA and offers higher function availability. If one cloud provider goes down (or pricing is cheaper elsewhere), Spotinst handles this for you under the hood.

### Edge location support

Reduce data transfer costs with edge location support. Unlike other edge FaaS solutions, Spotinst Functions doesnâ€™t have limitations on external api calls or execution time limits.

They are currently supporting 15 different locations around the US and 10+ locations in APAC, SEA & Europe.

### Function Analytics

- Invocation count & latency metrics, errors & HTTP response codes analytics
- Geo Location analytics
- Easy log debugging

### Pricing Example (Compute Only):

Lets see how pricing stacks up with an example.

With 500,000 Requests per Minute (21,600,000,000 Monthly) with 256MB of RAM & <10ms execution time, the prices would break down like so:

- Google Functions: **~$10,000 compute time**
- Amazon Lambda: **~$9,000  compute time**
- Microsoft Azure: **~$8,500**
- IBM Bluemix (Open Whisk): **~$9,000**
- Spotinst Functions: **~$2,000 (!)**

You can [sign up for a Spotinst account here](https://console.spotinst.com/#/auth/signUp)

### 2. Head into the functions console

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/spotinst-post/2._Head_into_the_functions_console.jpg "2._Head_into_the_functions_console.jpg")

Inside of Spotinst, head into the [Functions console](https://console.spotinst.com/functions).

[https://console.spotinst.com/functions](https://console.spotinst.com/functions)

### 3. Create a new Spotinst application

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/spotinst-post/3._Create_a_new_SpotInst_application.jpg "3._Create_a_new_SpotInst_application.jpg")

Create a new app and give it a name.

An `application` in Spotinst is a logical group of several environments. Most commonly, it stores environments that share the same business application (e.g., testing and production of a specific function). More on Spotinst applications [in the Spotinst docs](https://help.spotinst.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004156989-Application)

### 4. Create a new environment in the Spotinst application

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/spotinst-post/4._Create_a_new_environment_in_the_SpotInst_application.jpg "4._Create_a_new_environment_in_the_SpotInst_application.jpg")

Name the Environment and choose which regions and providers you want to run the function in.

This is where you can choose to run your function across cloud providers and within multiple regions. ðŸŽ‰

Inside Spotinst, the `environment` refers to a configuration group that contains actual Functions. [Learn more in the spotinst docs](https://help.spotinst.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004157229-Environment)

### 5a. Grab an API token in Spotinst settings
