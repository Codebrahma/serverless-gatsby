Tim Growney (along with the rest of the [Teespring](https://teespring.com/) team) had a problem—in their old office, the employee:bathroom ratio was 30:1. Aka, long lines were a daily occurrence.

Now, Tim could have accepted this as an inevitable fact of life. He could have settled for an old-fashioned queue, just like the rest of us.

But Tim didn't do that. Because Tim...is a *serverless engineer*. ⚡️

Watch below to see how he, in the span of a one-day work hackathon, created a serverless queueing system using IoT sensors.
