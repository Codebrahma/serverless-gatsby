In this post, I'll show you how to put multiple Serverless services on the same domain name. This is the [most requested issue in the Serverless repo](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3078) right now but is a tricky feature to implement directly within the Framework.

Using the power of Serverless and the [serverless-domain-manager](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-domain-manager) plugin, we can use API Gateway's [base path mappings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html#how-to-custom-domains-mapping-console) to handle this. Follow the instructions below to deploy your two services to the same domain.

_Addendum: Many users asked about how to deploy to different domains based on the stage, e.g. `staging-api.mycompany.com` when deploying to staging. I've added a section on [Working with multiple stages](#working-with-multiple-stages) below._

If you already have your own services set up and just want the simple instructions, skip to the [TL;DR section](#tldr) below.

#### Getting Started

To get started, you'll need the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/) installed.

You should also have your desired domain name registered through AWS. Read the documentation on that [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html). You should also register a certificate for that domain through the AWS Certificate Manager. If you need help with that, read the _Getting a certificate for your domain_ section of my previous post on [using API Gateway with Serverless](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain/).

#### Deploying your two services

Before we dive it, let's discuss exactly what we're trying to build. Imagine you have an e-commerce store which is a single-page application that consumes a backend REST API. Your REST API is hosted at `api.mycompany.com`, and you have two services: `users` and `products`.

You would like all `users` requests to be accessed at `api.mycompany.com/users` while all `products` requests would be accessed at `api.mycompany.com/products`. Further, you would like to separate these two services so they could be deployed independently -- changes to a products endpoint wouldn't require a redeploy of all users functions as well.

For this example, do the following:

First, create a new directory for your application:

```bash
$ mkdir api-gateway-application
$ cd api-gateway-application
```

Then, create a directory for your `users` service:

```bash
$ mkdir users-service
$ cd users-service
```

In your `users-service` directory, add the following `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
# serverless.yml

service: users-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.6
  stage: dev
  region: us-east-1
  environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: ${self:service}

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http: GET hello
```

Then add the following as `handler.py`:

```python
# handler.py

import os


def hello(event, context):
    response = {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "Hello from the {}!".format(os.environ.get('SERVICE_NAME'))
    }

    return response
```

This is a super simple service with a single endpoint (`/hello`) that will return the name of the service. To test it, deploy the service:

```bash
$ sls deploy
...
Service Information
service: users-service
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: users-service-dev
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://n0benf6jn4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello
functions:
  hello: users-service-dev-hello
```

Copy and paste the endpoint into your browser, and you should see the following message:

<img width="697" alt="User Service Example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/30782885-7557f496-a0ff-11e7-86e7-7cddc1e4fb06.png">

As you can see, the URL isn't very friendly. We'll fix that during this walkthrough. To finish our setup, let's make a products service as well. Move up a level in your directory structure, then copy the users-service into a products-service directory:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ cp -r users-service/ products-service
$ cd products-service
```

Then edit the name of the `service` in your products-service `serverless.yml`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

service: products-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.6
  stage: dev
  region: us-east-1
  environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: ${self:service}

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http: GET hello
```

Run `sls deploy` to deploy the products-service, and make sure it's working in your browser:

<img width="682" alt="Product Service Example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/30782947-8ba43a56-a100-11e7-9003-d52911cdac3b.png">

Again, it's an ugly URL, which we're going to change soon.

#### Adding your services to your custom domain

Now that we have our two services set up, let's add them to a custom domain. You should still be in your `products-service`. Let's install the [serverless-domain-manager](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-domain-manager) plugin:

```bash
$ npm init -f
$ npm install serverless-domain-manager
```

Then add the configuration to your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

service: products-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.6
  stage: dev
  region: us-east-1
  environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: ${self:service}

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http: GET hello

plugins:
  - serverless-domain-manager

custom:
  customDomain:
    domainName: 'api.mycompany.com' # Change this to your domain.
    basePath: 'products' # This will be prefixed to all routes
    stage: ${self:provider.stage}
    createRoute53Record: true
```

We've added two sections to the `serverless.yml`. First, we registered the `serverless-domain-manager` in the `plugins` block. Then, we configured the plugin via the `customDomain` section of the `custom` block.

Note the `basePath` attribute that we're configuring. This will be prefixed to every route in our `products-service`. Thus, our route that is registered as `/hello` will actually be located at `products/hello`.

If you haven't previously registered this domain with API Gateway, you'll need to register it:

```bash
$ serverless create_domain
Serverless: Domain was created, may take up to 40 mins to be initialized
```

As the output notes, it can take up to 40 minutes to provision this in AWS. This is a one-time setup cost.

Once your domain is set up, deploy your service with `sls deploy`. Once the deploy is done, your endpoint will be available at `api.mycompany.com/products/hello`:

<img width="605" alt="Products Service Base Path" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/30783072-03c6a8fa-a103-11e7-9402-36717b131077.png">

That's a much cleaner URL!

Let's do the same with our users service. Change into that directory:

```bash
$ cd ../users-service
```

and follow the same steps as above. Install the `serverless-domain-manager` plugin:

```bash
$ npm init -f
$ npm install serverless-domain-manager
```

and add the config to your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

service: users-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.6
  stage: dev
  region: us-east-1
  environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: ${self:service}

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http: GET hello

plugins:
  - serverless-domain-manager

custom:
  customDomain:
    domainName: 'api.mycompany.com' # Change this to your domain.
    basePath: 'users' # This will be prefixed to all routes
    stage: ${self:provider.stage}
    createRoute53Record: true
```

Note that the `basePath` in this one is `users`, which will be prefixed to all routes in the users-service.

You don't need to run `serverless create_domain` again. Because you created the domain already, it is available for any services that want to use it.

Run `sls deploy` to deploy the users service, then check it in your browser:

<img width="604" alt="Users Service Base Path" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/30783122-81ead4f4-a103-11e7-9809-75e108e5506e.png">

That's it! Now you easily separate your functions into services while still keeping them on the same domain. You're not limited to two services on this domain -- as you add additional services, just use a new `basePath` to add it to your domain.

#### Working with multiple stages

> Addendum: A few people have asked about how to handle this with multiple stages (prod, staging, dev). I've added this section to show how to structure your project to handle this.

When working with Serverless services, you'll often have multiple stages for your project. In this section, I'll show you how to set up your project to deploy to custom domains for different stages.

To set the scene, let's imagine we have three stages:

- `prod`, which is accessible at `api.mycompany.com`;
- `staging`, which is accessible at `staging-api.mycompany.com`; and
- `dev`, which is accessible at `dev-api.mycompany.com`.

The first thing you need to do is get certificates for each of these domains in Amazon Certificate Manager. Please read the _Getting a certificate for your domain_ section of my previous post on [using API Gateway with Serverless](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain/).

Once you've done that, use the following config for your `custom` block in `serverless.yml`:

```yml
custom:
  stage: ${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}
  domains:
    prod: api.mycompany.com
    staging: staging-api.mycompany.com
    dev: dev-api.mycompany.com

  customDomain:
    basePath: ""
    domainName: ${self:custom.domains.${self:custom.stage}}
    stage: "${self:custom.stage}"
    createRoute53Record: true
```

Pay particular attention to this line:

`domainName: ${self:custom.domains.${self:custom.stage}}"`

We're using the Serverless Framework's powerful [variable system](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables/) to infer the domain name based on the stage. I've set up my three stages in the `domains` block of the `custom` section. This will use my given stage to determine which domain to use.

Once this is set up, you'll need to create your custom domain _for each of your stages_. This is a one-time setup step. If you use the stages I gave above, you would run:

```bash
$ sls create_domain --stage prod
$ sls create_domain --stage staging
$ sls create_domain --stage dev
```

Once your domains are set up, you can deploy to your proper stages! Use `sls deploy --stage prod` to deploy to `api.mycompany.com` and the other stages to deploy to their respective domains.

#### TL;DR

If you already have multiple services set up and are looking to add them to the same domain, follow these steps.

Before you begin, you'll need to get a certificate for your domain with the AWS Certificate Manager and register your domain with API Gateway. To do that, follow the steps in my previous post on [using a custom domain with API Gateway and Serverless](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain/). Stop after the step that says `sls create_domain`.

In each service, install the [serverless-domain-manager](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-domain-manager) plugin:

```bash
$ npm install serverless-domain-manager
```

Then, add the following configuration to your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

plugins:
  - serverless-domain-manager

custom:
  customDomain:
    domainName: 'api.mycompany.com' # Change this to your domain.
    basePath: 'myprefix' # This will be prefixed to all routes
    stage: ${self:provider.stage}
    createRoute53Record: true
```

Make sure you change the `domainName` value to the domain name you want to use. Change the `basePath` value to the prefix you want for your routes in that service. For example, if you want your routes to start with `/products/`, the `basePath` value should be `products`.

Then, run `sls deploy` to get your service deployed to your custom domain with a base path!
