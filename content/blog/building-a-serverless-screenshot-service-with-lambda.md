A client recently requested a feature involving screenshots of random URLs. Now, there are several services out there that will do this for you. Most of these services have interesting REST APIs and pricing models, but I really wanted to develop something with [Serverless](https://serverless.com/). So I took this opportunity to check it out.

This application will run on AWS Lambda. You can find all the source code mentioned in [this repository](https://github.com/svdgraaf/serverless-screenshot).

**Quick installation**
====================

If you just want to launch the service yourself, you can use this button which will setup everything for you in your AWS account through the magic of CloudFormation:

[![Launch Awesomeness](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/new?stackName=serverless-screenshot-service&templateURL=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/serverless-screenshots-service/2016-09-23T12%3A50%3A03/template.yml)

**Overview**
--------

We're going to create a service to which we can `POST` a URL. It will capture and store a screenshot of the given URL for us, then return a URL where we can download the screenshot. We also want to generate different thumbnail sizes of every screenshot, and we want to be able to list all the available thumbnail sizes of a URL.

The architecture of what we're going to build, looks like this:

![Lambda Screenshot Architecture](https://github.com/svdgraaf/serverless-screenshot/raw/master/docs/architecture.png)

*Architecture for this project*

The app posts to [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), which triggers a Lambda function that will take the screenshot and upload it to the S3 bucket. It will then return the URL for the created screenshot.

When the file gets uploaded (putObject) to the S3 bucket, it will trigger the `Create Thumbnails` function, which will take the screenshot as input and use ImageMagick to create several thumbnail versions of the given image, and then upload those to the same bucket.

Lastly, there will be a function that the app can call to get a list of all available thumbnail sizes. The app can use the returned URLs to present them to the end user and their browser will download it through [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) from S3.

You can find all the source code for this project in this [repository](https://github.com/svdgraaf/serverless-screenshot).

**List of resources**
-----------------

For this project we're going to need to setup:

 * One Lambda function triggered by a `POST` event
 * One Lambda function triggered by a `GET` event
 * One Lambda function triggered by an S3 `CreateObject` event
 * Extra IAM Role access for the screenshot bucket
 * An S3 bucket for the screenshots
 * A CloudFront distribution for serving the screenshots


**Getting Started**
===============

This is my first project in Node.js, so bear with me (I'm more of a Python guy). Any tips or PRs are greatly appreciated.

When you download the project you can just run a `npm install` to install all of the requirements and get started. Keep reading if you want to follow along from scratch. Be sure to install the latest Serverless version (`npm install -g serverless`).

We'll start the project by creating a new project in the current directory:
```bash
serverless create --template aws-nodejs
```
We now have a directory with a couple of files:

```bash
ls -l
total 32
-rw-r--r--  1 svdgraaf  staff    54 Sep  6 19:44 README.md
-rw-r--r--  1 svdgraaf  staff    63 Sep  6 19:48 event.json
-rw-r--r--  1 svdgraaf  staff   128 Sep  6 19:48 handler.js
-rw-r--r--  1 svdgraaf  staff  1754 Sep  6 19:48 serverless.yml
```
The `handler.js` file will contain our functions, and with `event.json` we can simulate our calls. I later moved this to an `events` directory so I could simulate multiple events for the other calls.

Let's first take a look at the `serverless.yml` file that contains the configuration for our Service.

**Provider configuration**
----------------------

First, we need to setup our provider configuration--in this case we'll use `aws`, with `nodejs4.3`. We'll also add an API key so we can securely use our API, and add some IAM rules to allow the functions to list and upload to the S3 bucket.
```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs4.3
  stage: dev

  # We want to lock down the ApiGateway, so we can control who can use the api
  apiKeys:
    - thumbnail-api-key

  # We need to give the lambda functions access to list and write to our bucket, it needs:
  # - to be able to 'list' the bucket
  # - to be able to upload a file (PutObject)
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: "Allow"
     Action:
        - "s3:ListBucket"
        - "s3:PutObject"
      Resource: { "Fn::Join" : ["", ["arn:aws:s3:::", { "Ref" : "ThumbnailBucket" } ] ]  }
```
**Functions**
---------

We need to create three functions: one for taking a screenshot (called, you guessed it: `takeScreenshot`), one for creating a thumbnail of the screenshots (`createThumbnails`), and one for listing the available screenshot sizes (`listScreenshots`).

```yaml
functions:
  takeScreenshot:
    handler: handler.take_screenshot
    timeout: 15  # our screenshots can take a while sometimes
    events:
      - http:
          path: screenshots
          method: post
          # Marking the function as private will require a valid api-key
          private: true
          request:
            # we want to mark the url param as required
            parameters:
              querystrings:
                url: true

  listScreenshots:
    handler: handler.list_screenshots
    timeout: 15
    events:
      - http:
          path: screenshots
          method: get
          private: true
          request:
            parameters:
              querystrings:
                url: true

  createThumbnails:
    handler: handler.create_thumbnails
    events:
      # this event type will also create the screenshots bucket and trigger
      # the lambda function every time a file is uploaded (ObjectCreated)
      - s3:
          bucket: ${self:custom.bucket_name}
          event: s3:ObjectCreated:*
```

**Custom Resources**
----------------

We also need a CloudFront distribution to serve our screenshots. This is not supported by Serverless out of the box, so we need to create a custom resource for it. We'll also define some `Output`s, so we can use these later on.

```yaml
resources:
  Outputs:
    ScreenshotBucket:
      Description: "Screenshot bucket name"
      Value: ${self:custom.bucket_name}
    CloudFrontUrl:
      Description: "CloudFront url"
      Value: {"Fn::GetAtt": "CloudFrontEndpoint.DomainName"}

  Resources:
    # Create an endpoint for the S3 bucket in CloudFront
    # this configuration basically just sets up a forwarding of requests
    # to S3, and forces all traffic to https
    CloudFrontEndpoint:
      Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
      Properties:
        DistributionConfig:
          Enabled: True
          DefaultCacheBehavior:
            TargetOriginId: ScreenshotBucketOrigin
            ViewerProtocolPolicy: redirect-to-https
            ForwardedValues:
              QueryString: True
          Origins:
            -
              Id: ScreenshotBucketOrigin
              DomainName: ${self:custom.bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com
              CustomOriginConfig:
                OriginProtocolPolicy: http-only
```

**Plugin variables**
----------------

We use the [stage-variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-plugin-stage-variables) plugin so we can set stage variables in API Gateway, which we can then use in our Lambda functions. You can configure them in the `custom` section. This also allows us to use [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) references inside our Lambda functions. CloudFormation will fill in the values with the actual output for us.

```yaml
custom:
  # change this, so it's unique for your setup
  bucket_name: ${self:provider.stage,opt:stage}-${env:USER}-screenshots

  # these variables are passed on through ApiGateway, to be used
  # in your functions in the event.stageVariables
  stageVariables:
    bucketName: ${self:custom.bucket_name}
    endpoint: {"Fn::Join": ["", ["https://", { "Fn::GetAtt": "CloudFrontEndpoint.DomainName" }, "/"]]}
```


**Defining functions**
==================

You should define your functions in the `handler.js` file. In our case, it will hold three functions: `take_screenshot`, `list_screenshots` and `create_thumbnails`. You can use the `handler` definition in the `functions` section of `serverless.yml` to give you the option of using different files if you want to separate them. The actual implementations of the functions are in the [repository](https://github.com/svdgraaf/serverless-screenshot/blob/master/handler.js).

The functions will always receive three variables: `event`, `context` and `cb`. The `event` will contain the event that triggered the Lambda (in our case, either an API Gateway call or the S3 bucket event). The `context` variable contains the Lambda context to find out how much memory you have--the platform, etc. The `cb` (callback) variable can be used to signal for error or success.

**Event variables**
---------------

You will receive different events depending on which service it came from. In the case of our API Gateway events, we get a lot of info--headers, query parameters, stage variables, etc. In our case, we're only using `event.query` and `event.stageVariables`, but there is also `event.headers`, `event.body`, etc. The mapping to the event is defined by Serverless, and the default mapping (and fields) can be seen in the [repository](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/lib/plugins/aws/deploy/compile/events/apiGateway/lib/methods.js#L98).

**Extra binaries**
--------------

For this project we will need some extra binaries ([PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) in particular) to take the screenshots. We'll also use [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), but that is provided by AWS by default in the Lambda image, so we don't package it separately.

Serverless will package any extra files in the project directory automatically, so adding extra binaries is as simple as just creating a directory and adding the files.

If you need compiled binaries you can use [Amazon Machine Images (AMI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) to spin up an EC2 instance (or use this easy [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda/)), compile [your own binaries](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html), and copy them over to your project. The [project repository](https://github.com/svdgraaf/serverless-screenshot) already contains the binaries you can use.

**Deploying**
=========

We can deploy the application now that we have everything in place. It's a good idea to use different deployment environments, so let's start with a `dev` environment: `sls deploy -s dev`. This will zip everything together (including the binaries), create a deployment bucket, upload the zip file, and update the CloudFormation template with all the resources that we need.
```bash
sls deploy -s dev --verbose
```
(the `--verbose` will show you all the CloudFormation output during deployment, very nice!).

After the deployment is done, you will see the end results:
```yaml
Service Information
service: lambda-screenshots
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
endpoints:
  POST - https://123g1jc802.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/screenshots
  GET - https://123g1jc802.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/screenshots
functions:
  lambda-screenshots-dev-listScreenshots: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123123123123:function:lambda-screenshots-dev-listScreenshots
  lambda-screenshots-dev-createThumbnails: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123123123123:function:lambda-screenshots-dev-createThumbnails
  lambda-screenshots-dev-takeScreenshot: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123123123123:function:lambda-screenshots-dev-takeScreenshot
```

**Awesome!** Everything is up and running.


**Using the Service**
=================

We can test our service now that everything is deployed. You can use your favorite http client like `curl` or `postman` for this.

Since we configured our APIs to use API keys, we need to provide a valid API key with each request. Just add a head `x-api-key` with each request and it should work. You can grab the API keys from the API Gateway console or from the Serverless output with `sls info`.

**Creating a screenshot**
---------------------

To create a screenshot for `google.com`:
```bash
$ curl -X POST https://123g1jc802.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/screenshots?url=http://google.com/ -H "x-api-key: [yourkey]"
{
	"hash": "6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8",
	"key": "6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/original.png",
	"bucket": "dev-foobar-screenshots",
	"url": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/original.png"
}
```
**Listing all screenshot sizes**
----------------------------

To get all the different available sizes for `google.com`:
```bash
$ curl -X GET https://123g1jc802.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/screenshots?url=http://google.com/ -H "x-api-key: [yourkey]"
{
	"100": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/100.png",
	"200": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/200.png",
	"320": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/320.png",
	"400": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/400.png",
	"640": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/640.png",
	"800": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/800.png",
	"1024": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/1024.png",
	"1024x768": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/1024x768.png",
	"320x240": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/320x240.png",
	"640x480": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/640x480.png",
	"800x600": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/800x600.png",
	"original": "https://foobar.cloudfront.net/6ab016b2dad7ba49a992ba0213a91cf8/original.png"
}
```

**Cost**
=======

So how much will this cost you? If every call takes approximately 10 seconds (which is a safe bet, usually they are way faster). You could make 250 calls per month in the free tier, which wouldn't cost you a thing.

So creating at least 100.000 screenshots **per month** with 15 thumbnails per screenshot would be absolutely free.


**Conclusion**
==========

Taking screenshots with Lambda Wheneveris a great solution. There's no need to setup queuing, batch workers, etc. Lambda can handle the screenshots, thumbnails and storage.  a request comes in, it will automatically spin up, auto scaling to whatever you need.

Serverless makes it really easy to setup, configure and deploy your microservices. It's a seamless process to extend your services with other AWS services you might need for your project.
