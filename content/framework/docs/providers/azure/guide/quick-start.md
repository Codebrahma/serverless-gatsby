# Azure - Quick Start

## Pre-requisites

1. Node.js `v6.5.0` or later. *(this is the runtime version supported by Azure Functions)*
2. Serverless CLI `v1.9.0` or later. You can run
`npm install -g serverless` to install it.
3. Azure plugin that allows you to work with Azure Functions `npm install -g serverless-azure-functions`
4. An Azure account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) that includes $200 of free credit.
5. **Set-up your [Provider Credentials](../credentials)**.

## Create a new service

Create a new service using the Node.js template, specifying a unique name and an
optional path for your service. Make sure you enter a globally unique name for the `--name` argument.

```bash
$ serverless create --template azure-nodejs --path my-service --name my-unique-name
$ cd my-service
$ npm install
```

## Deploy and test

1. **Deploy the Service:**

  Deploy your new service to Azure! The first time you do this, you will be asked
  to authenticate with your Azure account, so the `serverless` CLI can manage
  Functions on your behalf. Simply follow the provided instructions, and the
  deployment will continue as soon as the authentication process is completed.

  ```bash
  serverless deploy
  ```

  > Note: Once you've authenticated, a new Azure "service principal" will be
  created, and used for subsequent deployments. This prevents you from needing to
  manually login again. See [below](#advanced-authentication) if you'd prefer to
  use a custom service principal instead.

2. **Deploy the Function**

  Use this to quickly upload and overwrite your function code,allowing you to
  develop faster. If you're working on a single function, you can simply deploy
  the specified function instead of the entire service.

  ```bash
  serverless deploy function -f hello
  ```

3. **Invoke the Function**

  Invoke a function, in order to test that it works:

  ```bash
  serverless invoke -f hello
  ```

4. **Fetch the Function Logs**

  Open up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific
  Function using this command.

  ```bash
  serverless logs -f hello -t
  ```

## Cleanup

If at any point, you no longer need your service, you can run the following
command to remove the Functions, Events and Resources that were created, and
ensure that you don't incur any unexpected charges.

```bash
serverless remove
```

Check out the [Serverless Framework Guide](.) for more information.

## Advanced Authentication

The getting started walkthrough illustrates the interactive login experience,
which is recommended for most users. However, if you'd prefer to create an Azure
["service principal"](http://bit.ly/2wLVE7k)
yourself, you can indicate that this plugin should use its credentials instead,
by setting the following environment variables:

**Bash**
```bash
export azureSubId='<subscriptionId>'
export azureServicePrincipalTenantId='<tenantId>'
export azureServicePrincipalClientId='<servicePrincipalName>'
export azureServicePrincipalPassword='<password>'
```

**Powershell**
```powershell
$env:azureSubId='<subscriptionId>'
$env:azureServicePrincipalTenantId='<tenantId>'
$env:azureServicePrincipalClientId='<servicePrincipalName>'
$env:azureServicePrincipalPassword='<password>'
```
