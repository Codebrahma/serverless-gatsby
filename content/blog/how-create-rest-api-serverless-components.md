#### Introduction

You might have already heard about our new project, [Serverless Components](https://github.com/serverless/components). Our goal was to encapsulate common functionality into so-called "components", which could then be easily re-used, extended and shared with other developers and other serverless applications.

In this post, I'm going to show you how to compose a fully-fledged, REST API-powered application, all by using several pre-built components from the [component registry](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry).

Excited? Let's go!

#### Wait, what are components again?

I'm going to start with [a quick refresher on Serverless Components](https://serverless.com/blog/what-are-serverless-components-how-use/). If you already know all about them, then jump straight to [install](#installing-serverless-components) or [building the app](#building-our-application).

In essence, components are logical units which encapsulate code to perform certain actions. Components expose an interface so that they can be re-used easily by others without them having to know the inner workings. They can be orchestrated and nested to build higher-order functionalities, like so:

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/components/serverless-components-photo-app-nesting.png">

To take a look at a simple example, let's imagine that we want to deploy multiple AWS Lambda functions to AWS.

### Doing this the old way

Taking a deeper look into AWS Lambdas internals, we see that every Lambda function needs an IAM role. Further, we need to configure parameters such as "Memory size" or "Timeout". We need to provide the zipped source code and ship it alongside our AWS Lambda function.

We could accomplish our task by manually creating an IAM role, configuring the ("Memory size" and "Timeout"), and zipping and uploading the code. But doing this manually is cumbersome and error-prone. And, there's no way to re-use common logic to create other AWS Lambda functions in the future.

##### Doing this with components

Enter: Serverless Components! The components concept provides an easy way to abstract away common functionality, making it easier to re-use that functionality in multiple places.

In our case, we would componentize the AWS IAM role into one component, which takes a `name` and the `service` as inputs, creates an IAM Role, and returns the `arn` as an output:

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/components-rest-api/iam-role-component-serverless.png">

We could similarly componetize the AWS Lambda function into another component, which takes the `name`, `memorySize`, `timeout`, `code` and `iamRole` as inputs, creates the AWS Lambda function, and returns the `arn` as an output:

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/components-rest-api/lambda-component-serverless.png">

Then, we'd be able re-use our two components to create dozens of AWS Lambda functions and their corresponding roles, without the need to manually create Lambda functions or IAM roles *ever again*.

Write once, use everywhere.

#### Installing Serverless Components

First up, you'll need to get [Serverless Components](https://github.com/serverless/components) installed on your machine.

Serverless Components is a CLI tool written in JavaScript that helps in deploying, testing, and removing our component-based applications.

To install, simply run: `npm install --global serverless-components`.

**Note:** Right now Serverless Components needs Node.js 8 or greater. Compatibility with older Node.js versions is [already in the making](https://github.com/serverless/components/pull/188).

#### Components we're using to build this API

Let's take a quick look at the different components we'll use throughout this tutorial to build our REST API-powered application.

##### `aws-lambda`

The [`aws-lambda`](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/aws-lambda) component gives us a convenient way to deploy Lambda functions to AWS.

When using it, we'll need to supply `memory`, `timeout`, and `handler` properties. All other configurations (such as the function `name`) are optional.

The Lambda component will even auto-generate and automatically manage an IAM role for us, if we don't specify one.

You can find the documentation and some examples in the [AWS Lambda component registry entry](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/aws-lambda).

##### `aws-dynamodb`

The [`aws-dynamodb`](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/aws-dynamodb) component makes it possible to create and manage DynamoDB tables.

The only configurations necessary for this component are (1) the `region`, in which the table should be created; (2) an array called `tables`, which includes the different DynamoDB-specific table definitions.

The [components documentation](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/aws-dynamodb) shows some example uses.

##### `rest-api`

The [`rest-api`](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/rest-api) component creates a REST API according to a config consisting of a `gateway` and `routes` property.

##### `gateway` config

The `gateway` config property determines where the REST API should be created. The component currently supports `aws-apigateway` to setup a REST API on AWS using the API Gateway, and `eventgateway` to setup a REST API using the hosted version of [Event Gateway](https://serverless.com/event-gateway/).

In this post, we'll be using the `aws-apigateway` configuration to tell the Framework that we want to set up our REST API on AWS using the API Gateway service.

##### `routes` config

The `routes` config property is used to specify the routes with its paths and methods and maps them to the Lambda functions which should be invoked when accessing those routes.

If for example, you want to implement a "Products" API you'd create routes like this:

| Method   | Path             | Description                                |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | `/products`      | List all products                          |
| `GET`    | `/products/{id}` | Get the product with id `{id}`             |
| `POST`   | `/products`      | Take product data and create a new product |
| `DELETE` | `/products/{id}` | Delete the product with the id `{id}`      |

That's it. When deploying the component to AWS, the Framework will automatically create a REST API using the API Gateway service and return the URLs we can use to perform the above operations.

You can find the documentation and some examples in the [REST API component registry entry](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/rest-api).

#### Building our application

Enough theory. Let's dive right into the code and build an application!

##### Creating a component project

Let's start by creating a new components project. A components project is simply a directory containing a `serverless.yml` file.

To start, create a new directory called `products-rest-api` by running `mkdir products-rest-api`. After `cd`ing into it, we'll need to create an empty `serverless.yml` file by running `touch serverless.yml`. Then, open this directory with your favorite code editor.

In order to tell Serverless that we have a components project, we need to add the following lines of code to our `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
type: rest-api-app
```

The `type` property tells the Framework that our application is called `rest-api-app`.

If you compare this information with `serverless.yml` files from components [in the registry](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry), you might see that they too have a `type` property at the root level. This is because our `rest-api-app` application is itself a component, which could be re-used by other components or projects.

**There is no distinction between an application or a component. Both are components at the end of the day.**

##### Adding a `products` DB table

Since our REST API will be used to store and retrieve product data, we'll need to have a database backend to persist such products.

The `aws-dynamodb` component makes it easy for us to use and manage AWS DynamoDB tables. Let's add this component to our application.

Add the following code into your projects `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
# ... snip

components:
  productsDb:
    type: aws-dynamodb
    inputs:
      region: us-east-1
      tables:
        - name: products
          hashKey: id
          indexes:
            - name: ProductIdIndex
              type: global
              hashKey: id
          schema:
            id: number
            name: string
            description: string
            price: number
          options:
            timestamps: true
```

With this code snippet, we've officially added the first component to our project!

Components can be added and configured in the `components` section, and configured via `inputs`. In our example, we've added a component we called `productsDb` with the `type` `aws-dynamodb`. We then created a new DynamoDB table called `products` in the `us-east-1` region.

Our database schema is defined with the `schema` property, and defines the products properties `id`, `name`, `description` and `price`.

##### Adding our Lambda functions

The next thing we need to do is add AWS Lambda functions to create and list our products.

We'll store our Lambda code in a file called `products.js` which is located in a directory called `code` in the projects root directory (`code/products.js`).

Let's start with the `createProduct` function, which will insert a new product into the database.

##### `createProduct`

Paste the following code into the `products.js` file:

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const dynamo = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({ region: 'us-east-1' })

const tableName = process.env.productTableName

function create(evt, ctx, cb) {
  const item = JSON.parse(evt.body)
  dynamo.put({
    Item: item,
    TableName: tableName
  }, (err, resp) => {
    if (err) {
      cb(err)
    } else {
      cb(null, {
        statusCode: 201,
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(resp)
      })
    }
  })
}

module.exports = {
  create
}
```

Here, we imported the AWS SDK, which is required to make AWS SDK calls. Then, we created a new DynamoDB instance called `dynamo`.

We fetched the `table` name from the function's environment variables and defined our `create` function, which includes the logic to insert a new product record into the database.

Note that we're already using an event shape which corresponds to the AWS API Gateway event definitions.

Next up, we need to add an AWS Lambda component to our `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
# ... snip

components:
  # ... snip
  createProduct:
    type: aws-lambda
    inputs:
      memory: 512
      timeout: 10
      handler: products.create
      root: ./code
      env:
        productTableName: products
```

Here, we're adding our `createProcuct` component which is of `type` `aws-lambda`.

We've defined the function's configuration with the help of the component's `inputs` section. Note that we're specifing the path to our function's code with the help of the `root` property and the environment variables via `env`.

##### `getProduct` and `listProducts`

Let's add the functionality to fetch a single product (`getProduct`), as well as all products (`listProducts`), from the database.

Add the following JavaScript code to the `products.js` file:

```js
// ... snip

function get(evt, ctx, cb) {
  const vId = parseInt(evt.pathParameters.id, 10)
  dynamo.get({
    Key: {
      id: vId
    },
    TableName: tableName
  }, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      cb(err)
    } else {
      const product = data.Item
      cb(null, {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(product)
      })
    }
  })
}

function list(evt, ctx, cb) {
  dynamo.scan({
    TableName: tableName
  }, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      cb(err)
    } else {
      const products = data.Items
      cb(null, {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(products)
      })
    }
  })
}

module.exports = {
  // ... snip
  get,
  list
}
```

With this code, we simply defined and exported two functions, called `get` and `list`, which will query our DynamoDB database and return the result formatted in a way the API Gateway understands.

Let's add two new AWS Lambda components to our `serverless.yml`—one component for the `get` function and one for the `list` function:

```yml
# ... snip

components:
  # ... snip
  getProduct:
    type: aws-lambda
    inputs:
      memory: 512
      timeout: 10
      handler: products.get
      root: ./code
      env:
        productTableName: products
  listProducts:
    type: aws-lambda
    inputs:
      memory: 512
      timeout: 10
      handler: products.list
      root: ./code
      env:
        productTableName: products
```

Here, we declared two function components called `getProduct` and `listProducts`, which are of `type` `aws-lambda`. Both functions were configured via `inputs`, and refer to the same code location as our `createProcuct` function.

We also passed in the corresponding environment variables via `env` to ensure that our Lamdba functions had access to our DynamoDB table name.

That's it from an AWS Lamdba functions perspective!

##### Adding the `rest-api` components

The last missing piece is the `rest-api` component, which ties everything together and makes it possible to interact with our Products application end-to-end.

Adding and configuring our REST API is as easy as adding the corresponding component configuration to our `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
# ... snip

components:
  # ...snip
  productsApi:
    type: rest-api
    inputs:
      gateway: aws-apigateway
      routes:
        /products:
          post:
            function: ${createProduct}
            cors: true
          get:
            function: ${listProducts}
            cors: true
          /{id}:
            get:
              function: ${getProduct}
              cors: true
```

Here, we created our `productsApi` REST API using the component with the `type` `rest-api`. Via `inputs`, we configured it to use the `aws-apigateway` component under the hood as our `gateway` of choice.

Then, we defined our `routes`. Generally speaking, we defined 3 routes, one for each function. We made `/products` accessible via `GET` and `POST`, and specific products accessible at `/products/{id}` via `GET`.

A speciality in this component definition is the use of Serverless Variables via `${}`. [Serverless Variables](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables/) makes it easy for us to reference different values from different sources: environment variables, component outputs, or the `serverless.yml` file itself.

In our case, we're referencing the AWS Lambda components by name and passing those functions into our `rest-api` component. This way, the component knows how to configure the REST API so that the corresponding function is called when a request is sent to the endpoint.

Enabling `cors` for our endpoints is as easy as adding the `cors: true` configuration to our route.

##### Deploy and testing

That's it! We wrote all the necessary code to set up and configure our fully-fledged REST API!

We now have a REST API which is accessible via 3 different API endpoints. This REST API will trigger our AWS Lambda functions, which in turn reach out to DynamoDB to query our products.

Let's Deploy and test our application!

Deploying is as easy as running `components deploy`.

We can see our API Gateway endpoints at the end of the deployment logs. It should look something like this:

```
REST API resources:
  POST - https://3412ssa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products
  GET - https://3412ssa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/producst
  GET - https://3412ssa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products/{id}
```

Let's insert a new product.

We can `curl` our `/products` endpoint via `POST`:


```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://3412ssa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Learning Serverless Components",
      "description": "A tutorial to learn the new Serverless Components concept.",
      "price": 15
    }'
```

Great! Now we should be able to get our inserted product via the following `GET` request:

```
curl https://3412ssa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products/1
```

A list of all products can be requested like this:

```
curl https://3412ssa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products
```

Nice! Feel free to continue playing around with your REST API.

Once done, you can remove the application via `components remove`.

#### Conclusion

We've just created our very first product REST API via Serverless Components. And we did it by using three different pre-built components from the [Serverless Components registry](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry) (`aws-lambda`, `aws-dynamodb` and `rest-api`).

Setting everything up was as easy as adding the function logic and the corresponding component configurations in our `serverless.yml` file.

I hope that you've enjoyed this tutorial, and got a feeling for how powerful Serverless Components are.

You could enhance this project further by adding a static website interface with the help of the [`static-website` component](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry/static-website).

The [`examples`](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/examples) section in our Serverless Components repository is another great resource to get some inspiration what else you can build with the Serverless Components framework.
