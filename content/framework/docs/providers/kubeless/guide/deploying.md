# Kubeless - Deploying

The Serverless Framework was designed to provision your Kubeless Functions and Events.  It does this via a couple of methods designed for different types of deployments.

## Deploy All

This is the main method for doing deployments with the Serverless Framework:

```bash
serverless deploy -v
```

Use this method when you have updated your Function, Event or Resource configuration in `serverless.yml` and you want to deploy that change (or multiple changes at the same time) to your Kubernetes cluster.

### How It Works

The Serverless Framework translates all syntax in `serverless.yml` to [the Function object API](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/blob/master/pkg/spec/spec.go) calls to provision your Functions and Events.

For each function in your `serverless.yml` file, Kubeless will create an Kubernetes Function object and for each HTTP event, it will create a [Kubernetes service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

For example, let's take the following example `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
service: new-project
provider:
  name: kubeless
  runtime: python2.7

plugins:
  - serverless-kubeless

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
```

When deploying that file, the following objects will be created in your Kubernetes cluster:

```
$ kubectl get functions

NAME      KIND
hello     Function.v1.k8s.io
```

```
$ kubectl get all

NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/hello-6997830dk15r   1/1       Running   0          2m

NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
svc/hello        10.0.0.39    <none>        8080/TCP   2m

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/hello   1         1         1            1           2m

NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/hello-699783077   1         1         1         2m
```

Kubeless will create a [Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for your function and a [Kubernetes service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) for each event.

## Deploy Function

This deployment method updates or deploys a single function. It performs the platform API call to deploy your package without the other resources. It is much faster than redeploying your whole service each time.

```bash
serverless deploy function --function myFunction
```

### Tips

Check out the [deploy command docs](../../cli-reference/deploy) for all details and options.
