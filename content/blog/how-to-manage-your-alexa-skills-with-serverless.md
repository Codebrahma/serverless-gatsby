# Introduction

Masashi here, creator of the Serverless Alexa plug-in.

Serverless and IoT go hand in hand, and it's easy to use the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/) to develop AWS Lambda functions for Alexa Skills.

Unfortunately, you can't control Alexa Skills with the Framework, which was a bummer to me because I found the Alexa Skills Kit webapp and [ask-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ask-cli) didn't have the simplicity I'd come to love with the Serverless Framework.

But! Luckily, the Serverless Framework has a great plugin system. I decided to solve this little problem with the power of the community!

# Overview
The [Serverless Alexa Skills Plugin](https://github.com/marcy-terui/serverless-alexa-skills) lets you integrate Alexa Skills into the Serverless Framework. We can now control the manifest and interaction model of Alexa Skills using `sls` command and `serverless.yml`!

# How to use it

## Installation
The plugin is hosted by npm:

```
$ npm install -g serverless
$ sls plugin install -n serverless-alexa-skills
```

## Get your credentials
`Login with Amazon` is an OAuth2.0 single sign-on (SSO) system using your Amazon.com account.

To get your credentials, log in to the [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/), go to `Login with Amazon` from `APPS & SERVICES`, and then `Create a New Security Profile`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcy-terui/serverless-alexa-skills/master/images/developer_console.png)

For following columns, you can enter whatever you like:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcy-terui/serverless-alexa-skills/master/images/create_security_profile.png)

Go to the `Web Settings` of the new security profile:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcy-terui/serverless-alexa-skills/master/images/security_profile_menu.png)

`Allowed Origins` can be empty. Enter `http://localhost:3000` in` Allowed Return URLs`. This port number can be changed with `serverless.yml`, so if you want to change this, please do so:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcy-terui/serverless-alexa-skills/master/images/web_setting.png)

Remember your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` of the new security profile, as well as `Vendor ID`. You can check your `Vendor ID` at [here](https://developer.amazon.com/mycid.html).

You only need to do this process once. You can continue to use the same credentials as long as you use the same account.

**The troublesome browser click-work is over!** 👏 Let's move on to the `sls` command.

## Put your credentials into the Framework
Write the `Client ID`,` Client Secret`, and `Vendor ID` to `serverless.yml`. It is good to use environment variables as it is shown below.

Change the port number with `Allowed Return URLs` of `Login with Amazon`, add `localServerPort`, and write the port number:

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs 6.10

plugins:
  - serverless-alexa-skills

custom:
  alexa:
    vendorId: ${env:AMAZON_VENDOR_ID}
    clientId: ${env:AMAZON_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret: ${env:AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

Then, execute the following command:

```
$ sls alexa auth
```

This command opens the login page of Amazon.com in your browser. You will be redirected to `localhost:3000` after authenticating. If the authentication is successful, you'll see the message: `"Thank you for using Serverless Alexa Skills Plugin!!"`.

**note:** The security token expires in 1 hour. Therefore, if an authentication error occurs, please re-execute the command. I'm planning to implement automatic token refreshing in the future.

# Create your skill
Let's make a skill!

To start, execute the following command:

```
$ sls alexa create --name $YOUR_SKILL_NAME --locale $YOUR_SKILL_LOCALE --type $YOUR_SKILL_TYPE
```

These are descriptions of the options:

- name: Name of the skill
- locale: Locale of the skill (`en-US` for English, `ja-JP` for Japanese and so on)
- type: Type of the skill (`custom` or `smartHome` or `video`)

## Update the skill manifest
A manifest is initially set for the skill. You can check the manifest with the following command:

```
$ sls alexa manifests

Serverless:
------------------
[Skill ID] amzn1.ask.skill.xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx
[Stage] development
[Skill Manifest]
manifest:
  publishingInformation:
    locales:
      ja-JP:
        name: sample
  apis:
    custom: {}
  manifestVersion: '1.0'
```

Copy `[Skill ID]` and `[Skill Manifest]` and paste it to `serverless.yml` as below.

```yaml
custom:
  alexa:
    vendorId: ${env:AMAZON_VENDOR_ID}
    clientId: ${env:AMAZON_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret: ${env:AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET}
    skills:
      - id: ${env:ALEXA_SKILL_ID}
        manifest:
          publishingInformation:
            locales:
              en-US:
                name: sample
          apis:
            custom:
              endpoint:
                uri: arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name
          manifestVersion: '1.0'
```

Execute the following command to update the manifest after updating your `serverless.yml` (or you can use the `--dryRun` option to check the difference between the local setting and the remote setting without updating):

```
$ sls alexa update
```

You can see the format of the manifest [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/skill-manifest.html#sample-skill-manifests).

## Building the interaction model
The skill does not have an interaction model at first, so you'll need to write an interaction model definition to `serverless.yml`.

Like this!

```yaml
custom:
  alexa:
    vendorId: ${env:AMAZON_VENDOR_ID}
    clientId: ${env:AMAZON_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret: ${env:AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET}
    skills:
      - id: ${env:ALEXA_SKILL_ID}
        manifest:
          publishingInformation:
            locales:
              en-US:
                name: sample
          apis:
            custom: {}
          manifestVersion: '1.0'
        models:
          en-US:
            interactionModel:
              languageModel:
                invocationName: PPAP
                intents:
                  - name: PineAppleIntent
                    slots:
                    - name: Fisrt
                      type: AMAZON.Food
                    - name: Second
                      type: AMAZON.Food
                    samples:
                     - 'I have {First} and {Second}'
```

You can see the format of the interaction model [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/custom-interaction-model-reference.html).

Execute the following command to build the model after updating your `serverless.yml` (and you can also use the `--dryRun` option with this command):

```
$ sls alexa build
```

Then, you can check the model like so:

```
$ sls alexa models

Serverless:
-------------------
[Skill ID] amzn1.ask.skill.xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx
[Locale] ja-JP
[Interaction Model]
interactionModel:
  languageModel:
    invocationName: ppap
    intents:
      - name: PineAppleIntent
        slots:
        - name: First
          type: AMAZON.Food
        - name: Second
          type: AMAZON.Food
        samples:
         - I have {First} and {Second}
```

# That's it!
There are a few more steps needed in order to completely publish skills, so I'm planning to do further integrations with the Alexa Skills Kit in the future. It's still pretty great to be able to integrate manifests and models, since we update those many times as we develop. All the better if we can manage them with the source code of our Lambda functions!

# Summary
Now, we can completely manage our Lambda Functions and Alexa Skills with Serverless Framework + Serverless Alexa Skills Plugin!
