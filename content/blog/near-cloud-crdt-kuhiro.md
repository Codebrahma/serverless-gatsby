[Kuhirō](http://www.kuhiro.com) founder Russell Sullivan came to chat with us about the latest hot topic in serverless—[CRDTs](https://serverless.com/blog/crdt-explained-supercharge-serverless-at-edge/).

CRDTs got several mentions at ServerlessConf 2017 in NYC, but not many people fully understand what they do, or what their potential is. (...yet.)

Russell's talk will take you through some important concepts. Get up to speed on NearCloud, CRDTs, and Kuhirō.
