          Feedback from the client was uniformly positive. They exceeded their goal with over a million individual users and the site was visited from over 50 countries - it was even mentioned in a tweet from David Guetta himself! They also met their goals from a performance point of view. In fact, the performance turned out to follow the opposite pattern of whatâ€™s expected in traditional architectures - when they received more traffic, the site actually got faster.
