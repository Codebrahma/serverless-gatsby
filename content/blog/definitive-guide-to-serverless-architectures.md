[![Serverless Guide](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/guide_hero_big.png)](https://github.com/serverless/guide)

A lot is being written about serverless technology all over the web, and right now that information is fragmented. As a community, weâ€™re bringing it together.

Introducing the [**Serverless Guide**](https://github.com/serverless/guide): the definitive guide to serverless architectures.

Find everything you need to know about serverless development and organizations-patterns, best practices, case studies and everything in-between. This guide is also a collection and frank discussion about the state and maturity of serverless.

> The goal is to create a one-of-a-kind, trusted resource for developers, architects and thought leaders. A valuable resource that will help drive adoption and innovation of serverless architectures.

The Serverless Guide is a living artifact: an open-source, community-driven work. We are inviting all the serverless enthusiasts out there to contribute and spread the knowledge. Here's the list of [active contributors](https://github.com/serverless/guide/graphs/contributors) who have already jumped on board.
