We're happy to announce v1.7 of the Serverless Framework! Let's take a look at the release highlights.

## Highlights of 1.7.0

**Note:** You can find a complete list of all the updates in the [changelog](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### CloudWatch Events Support

Have you ever wanted to connect custom CloudWatch rules to fire your Lambda functions?

Serverless v1.7 has you covered and introduces the new `cloudwatchEvent` event source!

Here's an example of how the new `cloudwatchEvent` can be used:

```yml
functions:
  notifier:
    handler: handler.notifier
    events:
      - cloudwatchEvent:
          event:
            source:
              - "aws.ec2"
            detail-type:
              - "EC2 Instance State-change Notification"
            detail:
               state:
                 - pending
```

You can learn more about the new CloudWatch Event support in the [corresponding documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/cloudwatch-event/).

### Logging of Upcoming Deprecations

We heard you and we agree that introducing breaking changes can be pretty painful.

With this release we introduce logging messages that will show you what breaking changes will be introduced in the next release (v1.8 in this case).

You'll see them by default after upgrading to the new Serverless version but you can also disable them if you don't want to see them anymore.

The idea here is to inform you about all the upcoming breaking changes coming in the next release.

This should give you enough time to update your codebase so that Serverless will run smoothly.

As usual we keep the breaking changes as minimal as possible so that updating from one version to the next shouldn't be too hard.

### Reduced Memory Footprint During Zipping

Serverless is increasingly being used in CI/CD systems. The resources (i.e. CPU or Memory) of those systems often tend to be limited.

This release introduces a [one-line bug fix](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3220) that reduces the memory consumption during the zipping process by about ~40%.

This should make it easier for you to use Serverless on a less powerful machine like a CI/CD system.

### Enhancements & Bug Fixes

We've also fixed some nasty bugs and introduced some enhancements.

> Thanks for reporting bugs and opening issues to improve Serverless!

### Upcoming Breaking Changes

Here's a list of all the breaking changes that will be introduced in Serverless v1.8.

**Note:** You'll see the same list in the CLI if you run a Serverless command (as long as you haven't disabled it).

- [BREAKING - Replace IamPolicyLambdaExecution with inline policies and added ManagedPolicyArns to fix VPC permissions](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/2983)
- [BREAKING - Update function name displaying for info plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3239)

*You'll always get the most recent list of breaking changes when you take a look at the [upcoming milestone](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestones) or in the Serverless CLI.*
