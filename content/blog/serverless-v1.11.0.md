We're excited to announce that we've just released v1.11 of the Serverless Framework!

Here's an overview of the new features and improvements.

## Highlights of 1.11.0

**Note:** You can find a complete list of all the updates in the [changelog](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### CloudWatch Log event source

Have you ever wanted to call a Lambda function when something happens in one of your log groups? Serverless v1.11 introduces native support for `CloudWatch Log` events!

Here's an example configuration that will trigger the `alarm` Lambda function whenever something in the `/aws/lambda/alarms` log group happens:

```yml
functions:
  alarm:
    handler: handler.alarm
    events:
      - cloudwatchLog: '/aws/lambda/alarms'
```

You can also add a `filter` configuration so that the Lambda function is only triggered when the appended log in your log group matches the `filter`:

```yml
functions:
  notify:
    handler: handler.user
    events:
      - cloudwatchLog:
          logGroup: '/aws/lambda/users'
          filter: '{$.userIdentity.type = Root}'
```

You can read more about this new event source in the [`cloudwatchLog` docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/cloudwatch-log/).

### Mark functions to be packaged individually

Serverless has supported the ability to package functions individually for a while now. You could enable this feature by setting the `individually: true` configuration in the `package` service property:

```yml
package:
  individually: true
```

The drawback with this approach is that it's all-or-nothing. You can either let Serverless package your whole service as one large `.zip` file (the default behavior) or one `.zip` file per function (by using the `individually: true` config), but nothing in between.

Serverless v1.11 resolves this issue and let's you use the `individually: true` configuration on a function level.

The following example will create one service-wide `service.zip` file, but also one `world.zip` file for the `world` function:

```yml
service: service

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
  world:
    handler: handler.hello
    package:
      individually: true
```

### Description for Lambda versions

Lamdba versions will now pick up the function's description if you've provided one in your `serverless.yml` file.

This will make it easier to find specific versions if you want to e.g. rollback.

Here's a quick refresher on how you can use function descriptions:

```yml
service: service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs6.10

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    description: Prints out and logs a "Hello World"
```
