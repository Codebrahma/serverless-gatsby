# SNS

In the following example we create a new SNS topic with the name `dispatch` which is bound to the `dispatcher` function. The function will be called every time a message is sent to the `dispatch` topic.

```yml
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns: dispatch
```

You're also able to add the same SNS topic to multiple functions:

```yml
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns: dispatch
  dispatcher2:
    handler: dispatcher2.dispatch
    events:
      - sns: dispatch
```

This will run both functions for a message sent to the dispatch topic.

## Using a pre-existing topic

If an `arn:` is specified, the framework will give permission to the topic to invoke the function and subscribe the function to the topic.

```yml
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns: arn:xxx
```

```yml
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns:
          arn: arn:xxx
```

Or with intrinsic CloudFormation function like `Fn::Join` or `Fn::GetAtt`.

```yml
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns:
          arn:
            Fn::Join:
              - ""
              - - "arn:aws:sns:"
                - Ref: "AWS::Region"
                - ":"
                - Ref: "AWS::AccountId"
                - ":MyCustomTopic"
          topicName: MyCustomTopic
```

**Note:** It is important to know that `topicArn` must contain the value given in the `topicName` property.

## Setting a display name

This event definition ensures that the `aggregator` function gets called every time a message is sent to the
`aggregate` topic. `Data aggregation pipeline` will be shown in the AWS console so that the user can understand what the
SNS topic is used for.

```yml
functions:
  aggregator:
    handler: aggregator.handler
    events:
      - sns:
          topicName: aggregate
          displayName: Data aggregation pipeline
```

## Setting a filter policy

This event definition creates an SNS topic which subscription uses a filter policy. The filter policy filters out messages that don't have attribute key `pet` with value `dog` or `cat`.

```yml
functions:
  pets:
    handler: pets.handler
    events:
      - sns:
          topicName: pets
          filterPolicy:
            pet:
              - dog
              - cat
```
