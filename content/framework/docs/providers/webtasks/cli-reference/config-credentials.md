# Auth0 Webtasks - Config Credentials

Before you are able to use the Auth0 Webtasks platform with the Serverless Framework, you will need to setup a local profile. Fortunately, this takes less than a minute. 

```bash
serverless config credentials --provider webtasks
```

You will be asked for a phone number or email. You'll immediately receive a verification code. Enter the verification code and your profile will be entirely setup and ready to use.
