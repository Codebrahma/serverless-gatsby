# [Serverless Site](https://serverless.com/)

This site is 100% serverless! :tada:

Built using react, redux and [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) this site is statically built and hosted on the [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) CDN for ðŸ”¥blazingly fast performance and scale.

The [site content](https://github.com/serverless/site/tree/master/content), [docs](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/docs), and [blog](https://github.com/serverless/blog) are hosted on github, so if you see a typo or error feel free to contribute back!

API calls are made with the [serverless framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/docs) pinging AWS lambda functions. User Authentication is handled via [Auth0](https://auth0.com). Site search handled by [Algolia](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/).

# Quick Start

**1. Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:**

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

**2. Clone down the site**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:serverless/site.git
```

**3. Install site dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Run site on your local computer**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:8000

Run `npm run syncProd` or `npm run syncLocal` to pull in the blog and docs repos (if the postinstall command doesn't run for you). These 2 commands pull in the external content sources the site uses.

# Editing Site Content

Fork the site and submit a pull request!

When you start the site with `npm start` it will start watching for file changes and they will be automatically refreshed in the site on `http://localhost:8000`

### **Blog edits:**

To make edits to blog posts, edit the files in `./serverless-blog/posts` (this directory is added on `npm i`)

### **Doc edits:**

To make edits to framework docs, edit the files in `./serverless/docs` (this directory is added on `npm i`)

### Editing other pages

To make edits to other pages, edit the markdown in `./content`

Some pages have custom designs/layouts and the html might need to be altered. That content can be found in `./src/layouts` or `./src/pages`

# Publishing Site Updates

**1. Test the build command locally**

```bash
npm run build
```

**2. If build command succeeds, push up your changes to a new branch**

We are using [netlify](http://netlify.com) to distribute the site.

When pushing up to a new branch, netlify will automatically publish that change to a unique subdomain, like: `https://[lowercase-branch-name]--serverless.netlify.com`

For example the branch `updateDocsSetup` published to `https://updatedocssetup--serverless.netlify.com`

Successful deploys are published to the [notifications slack channel](https://serverlessteam.slack.com/archives/notifications)

**Note: The `master` branch is the live site. Never push directly to the master branch!**

**3. Review your live site changes**

If everything looks good on your unique netlify subdomain, you can go ahead and merge your branch to master on github.

Merging branches into master will trigger a site rebuild and `serverless.com` will be updated.
