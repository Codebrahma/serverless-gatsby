Today we're happy to announce the new Serverless Framework v1.17 release!

v1.17 provides new features, enhancements, and bugfixes. Let's take a deep dive into the new features v1.17 introduces.

## Highlights of 1.17.0

You can find a complete list of all the updates in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file or watch the video below.

Kudos to Ryan H. Lewis ([@ryanmurakami](https://twitter.com/ryanmurakami)) for taking the time to record this video!

### F# service template

With Serverless v1.17 you can now create and deploy F# service templates to AWS.

You can bootstrap your new F# service with the help of the `serverless create --template` command:

```bash
serverless create --template aws-fsharp --path my-fsharp-service
```

Next up you need to build the project:

```bash
cd my-fsharp-service

./build.sh
```

After that you're ready to deploy and invoke your first F# function:

```bash
serverless deploy

serverless invoke --function hello
```

The F# service template supports all the configs and event sources you can find in [our AWS documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/).

### Skip deployment if files not changed

Starting now, Serverless will automatically compare your current service files on disk to the remotely uploaded service files of your last deployment.

A re-deployment is only triggered if at least one of the files are different.

This feature is enabled by default and works for the `serverless deploy` and the `serverless deploy function` commands.

However you can still force a deployment by specifying the `--force` option like this:

```
serverless deploy --force
```

or

```
serverless deploy function --function func1 --force
```
