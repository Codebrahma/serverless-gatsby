Today we're excited to announce Serverless Framework v1.18!

The v1.18 release mostly focuses on enhancements and bug fixes. Let's take a look at some of the changes v1.18 introduces.

## Noteable changes v1.18 introduces

You can find a complete list of all the updates in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file or watch the video below.

Kudos to Ryan H. Lewis [(@ryanmurakami)](https://twitter.com/ryanmurakami) for taking the time to record this video!

### Request parameter support for Lambda Proxy integration

The `LAMBDA-PROXY` integration type now supports request parameters you can define in your `http` event definition:

```yml
service: my-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs6.10

functions:
  helloWorld:
    handler: handlers/handler.hello
    events:
      - http:
          path: /{name}
          method: GET
          request:
            parameters:
              querystrings:
                foo: true
              paths:
                bar: true
```

### Add default value for plugin options

Plugins now support default values for options. If specified the default value is used if the user does not provide a value when using the option via the CLI.

Here's an example how a plugin developer can use this feature:

```javascript
'use strict';

class MyPlugin {
  constructor(serverless, options) {
    this.serverless = serverless;
    this.options = options;

    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'functions'
        ],
        options: {
          function: {
            usage: 'Specify the function you want to deploy (e.g. "--function myFunction")',
            shortcut: 'f',
            required: true
          },
          stage: {
            usage: 'Specify the stage you want to deploy to. (e.g. "--stage prod")',
            shortcut: 's',
            default: 'dev' // the stage will default to dev if no option is provided
          }
        }
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'deploy:functions': this.deployFunction.bind(this)
    }
  }

  deployFunction() {
    console.log('Deploying function: ', this.options.function);
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### Add support to use JavaScript files via Serverless Variables

JavaScript files which e.g. export objects can now be referenced without defining the exported function which should be executed:

```yml
service:
  name: my-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs6.10

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello

custom: ${file(./unnamedExport.js)}
```

This comes in handy if you'd like to use traditional config tools such as [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) to configure your Serverless service.

### Other enhancements & bug fixes

## Upcoming releases / contributions

The Serverless Team is currently working on exciting new projects we'll announce at the [Emit conference](http://www.emitconference.com/) in August!

That's why upcoming Serverless releases will likely focus on bug fixes and minor enhancements.

However we could still include major features with the help of our community!

In addition to the [1.19 milestone](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestone/34) and its Issues and PRs we still have lots and lots of other [Issues](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pulls) we'd love to implement and introduce in some of the upcoming releases!

> Do you want to help out and improve the Serverless Framework?

Great! We've compiled a list with some of the most wished features to make it easier for you to find areas where help is greatly appreciated!

### Deploy many micro/nano services to one API Gateway

[Issue #3078](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3078)

We already started a WIP implementation with the following [PR](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3934). However for now it only provides a partial solution. Do you have any ideas how we can improve the support for this feature?

### Unable to create services with a high resource count

[Issue #2387](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2387)

Services can grow significantly in size. We've worked on different solutions for this problem (see [this PR](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3504)) but we're still not 100% there yet.

Could you imagine how we can resolve this problem in a reliable way?

### Support for AWS API Gateway Basic Request Validation

[Issue #3464](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3464)

We're currently looking for a way to implement basic request validation via raw CloudFormation.

### Let resources depend on the ApiGateway::Deployment

[Issue #2233](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2233)

The `ApiGateway::Deployment` resource has a random string in its name so that deployments are re-triggered on AWS end.

This makes it hard to create other CloudFormation resources which dependend on it.

### Skip resource if already exists

[Issue #3183](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3183)

It would be nice to skip resource delpoyments if the corresponding resource already exists (e.g. when using DynamoDB tables). Could you think of a reliable, production ready way which will detect which resources deployments could be skipped?

### Global arn parser with intrinsic functions (Ref, Fn::GetAtt, Fn::ImportValue, ...) support

[Issue #3212](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3212)

`arns` are used everywhere in CloudFormation. However some of our event sources don't support all the different types of intrinsic functions which can be used to reference `arns`.

It would be great to have a global `arn` parser which can be re-used throughout the whole codebase. Futhermore this parser could be exposed to the framework user e.g. via `this.provider.findAllCfReferences()` so that plugin authors can benefit from this functionality as well.

### Other issues and PRs

This list is just a gist with some of the most wished features from our community!

We have lots of other [issues](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues) where you could leave some feedback or jump directly into the implementation.

Additionally [PR reviews](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pulls) are also highly welcomed as they greatly speed up the "time-to-merge".

## Serverless Examples

The [Serverless Examples Repository](https://github.com/serverless/examples) is an excellent resource if you want to explore some real world examples and learn more about the Serverless Framework and serverless architectures in general.

## Serverless Plugins

Serverless provides a completely customizable and pluggable codebase. Our community has written a vast amount of awesome plugins you can install and therefore enhance the capabilities of the Framework.

A list with all the different plugins can be found at our [Serverless Plugins Repository](https://github.com/serverless/plugins).

Don't hestitate to open up a PR over there if you've authored or found a new Serverless plugin!
