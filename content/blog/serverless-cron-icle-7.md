*The open source [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) is backed by a super smart and extensive community of developers (we've passed 18,000 stars on GitHub). Besides contributing code, our community is passionate about sharing their knowledge and expertise. Here's a roundup of some of these articles, videos, and posts to help you keep up with the news in the serverless ecosystem.*

### [Serverless Web apps without client-side Javascript](https://adrianhesketh.com/2017/07/27/serverless-web-apps-without-client-side-javascript/)
When most people talk about Serverless architecture, they’re normally talking about REST APIs interacting with a javascript or mobile client, but it’s possible to use Serverless to process HTTP requests from Web browsers (including HTTP form posts) and respond with HTML. This is really powerful, because it allows you to build Web applications which don’t require a Web server to operate and don’t require javascript at the client-side. - *By [Adrian Hesketh](https://adrianhesketh.com/author/adrianhesketh/)*

While Apache Kafka™ is a messaging system of sorts, it’s quite different from typical brokers. It comes with both pros and cons and, like any technology we choose, this shapes the design of the systems we write. - *By [Ben Stopford](https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/ben/)*

### [Predictions for the direction of serverless platforms](https://www.morethanseven.net/2017/06/26/predictions-for-the-direction-of-serverless-platforms/)
I want to focus on a couple of things relevant to the evolution of Serverless as a platform and the resulting commercial ecosystem, namely the importance of Open Service Broker and a bet on OpenWhisk. - *By [Gareth Rushgrove](https://twitter.com/garethr)*
