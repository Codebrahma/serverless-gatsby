Here at Serverless, we've been working hard to deliver some holiday goodies.

Today we're proud to announce Serverless Framework v1.25.


## Changes v1.25 introduces

You can find a complete list of all the updates in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

Faster deployments? Yes, please!

This feature adds [S3 Transfer Acceleration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) support for uploading your deployment packages to S3. Rather than uploading to your region's origin for S3, it uploads the package to CloudFront edge locations and quickly transfers it to S3.

To enable this new feature, use the `--aws-s3-accelerate` flag when deploying your service:

```bash
$ sls deploy --aws-s3-accelerate
```

In testing, we've seen huge speedups in package uploads. In an example test, this was **42%** faster than using the normal S3 upload for someone located in the target AWS region. When uploading to a different region (e.g. from Italy to us-west-2), we saw **10x** speedups! ⚡️

Much thanks to [Alex Casalboni](https://twitter.com/alex_casalboni) for adding this feature!

### API Gateway Endpoint Type Configuration

AWS recently announced [regional endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-api-gateway-supports-regional-api-endpoints/) for API Gateway. These endpoints are accessed from the same region where your API Gateway REST API is deployed. This enables a lot of interesting use cases, including multi-region Serverless applications with lower latency or the ability to use AWS WAF with your API Gateway REST APIs.

You can enable this feature using the `endpointType` property in the `provider` block of your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

provider:
  name: aws
  endpointType: regional
...
```

Serverless defaults to an EDGE endpoint, which was the standard before AWS released regional endpoints.

### Improved variable processing

For power users of the Framework, the variable resolution could cause some issues. There are a number of bug fixes related to the variable system including [support for circular references](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4144) and a [few](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4499) [different](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4294) [PRs](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4518) to better handle resolving variables that call out to external services like CloudFormation, SSM, or S3.

These are huge improvements to the power and stability of the Framework, and they're difficult to implement in a consistent, non-breaking way. We appreciate the hard work of our community members in these fixes, particularly Framework core maintainer [Frank Schmid](https://github.com/HyperBrain), [Benjamin Forster](https://github.com/e-e-e), and long-time user [Erik Erikson](https://github.com/erikerikson). Be sure to thank these fine folks for their contributions!

### Other enhancements & bug fixes

This release also includes tons of other improvements and bug fixes.
